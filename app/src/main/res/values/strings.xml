        "Answer \n"
        "Each level has a different amounts of words and amount of categorization of the words and timer length. \n\n"

        "Question: How many attempts do I get to guess the song? \n"
        "Answer:\n"
        "You get 5 attempts, regardless if you play timed or not \n\n\n"
        "Question: How is the score calculated? \n"
        "Answer:\n"
        "Each "success" at the different levels contributes in the following way
        Easy - 1 points per success \n
        Medium - 2 points per success \n
        Hard - 3 points per success \n
        Insane - 4 points per success \n
        Impossible - 5 points per success \n
        \n\n\n"
        "Question: What do I need to play this game? \n"
        "Answer:\n"
        "You need a working data connection (preferably 4G for speed) and GPS enabled,
        you must also give the app permission for location services \n\n\n"

        "Question: How many songs are there? \n"
        "Answer:\n"
        "Currently there are 22 songs, although we are adding new songs all the time!
        Don't worry, the app will update automatically when this happens :-)\n\n\n"


        "Question: Can this app work offline? \n"
        "Answer:\n"
        "Not exactly, if you have a connection until the markers are in place that is fine, but you can only complete that game,
        You cannot load another game - including reloading the same level - unless you have a data connection, you also need location
        services at all times (otherwise its not much of a location puzzle game)
        \n\n\n"

        "Question: I am still having issues/ how do I give feedback? \n"
        "Answer:\n"
        "Please email me on my email address:
        mahbub@iftekhar.co.uk \n
        I will be happy to get feedback and or help you with any issues you may be having. Please allow 2 working days for a reply.
        \n\n\n"
